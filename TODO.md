# TODO

- [ ] Remove cheatsheet* files (I have whichkey for that now)
- [ ] Install [legendary](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) to have a "command palette" - integrated with "which-key"
- [ ] Migrate init.vim to init.lua
- [ ] Migrate from packer to lazy (link to only the package manager - not nvim lazy started kit): <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>). See also this explaining video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqlxqpHs-aQ>
    - [ ] Update <README.md>
